# mundus
The mundus repo is meant as a repo to house my Various Coding Dojo projects: ruby, python, html, css, other.

The nested folder structure mirrors a directory structure - which is not conducive to project collaboration.
Any projects requiring collaboration are hosted in their own repositories.
