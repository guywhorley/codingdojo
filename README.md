# codingdojo

This repository is meant as a convenient way to source control my various CodingDojo projects: ruby, python, html, css, others.

The nested folder structure mirrors a directory structure - which is not conducive to project collaboration.
Any projects requiring collaboration are hosted in their own repositories.
