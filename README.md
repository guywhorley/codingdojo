# codingdojo

## Description

This repository is meant as a convenient way to source control my CodingDojo projects: ruby, python, html, css, others.

Ignore the ugly, deeply-nested folder (granted - is not conducive to project collaboration). Any projects requiring collaboration are hosted in their own repositories at top level of Github.

## Contents <br>

1. Python/Pylot/Django exercises and code examples.<br>
2. Ruby/Rails/tdd/RSpec/Capybara exercises and code examples.<br>
3. MEAN stack exercises and code examples. <br>
